# Contact & Confirmation Experience Blueprint

## Contact Hero

- Layout mirrors home hero sidebar: left column (1-7) features headline, supportive text, and reassurance copy; right column (8-12) contains info card with phone, email, office hours, and quick action buttons.
- Info card styling uses glass panel treatment with location iconography and emergency contact highlight.
- Background includes subtle cityscape overlay to reinforce local presence.

## Multi-Step Form

- Step 1: Personal Details (Name, Email, Phone) with validation hints.
- Step 2: Case Information (Dropdown for incident type, text area for summary, optional file upload).
- Step 3: Contact Preferences (Preferred method, best time to reach, consent checkbox, anonymity preference for reviews).
- Progress indicator at top showing numbered steps; include "Back" and "Save for later" actions.
- Error handling: inline messages, summary at top for accessibility.

## Locations & Service Areas

- Two-column layout with interactive map on left and accordion list of service areas on right; on mobile, map collapses into toggle above accordions.
- Each accordion entry includes office address, phone, and `Get Directions` link.
- Provide `Schedule Meeting` CTA aligning with map.

## Confirmation Page (`thanks.html`)

- Hero message acknowledging submission, estimated response time, and advisor name if available.
- Include checklist of next steps (Gather documents, Expect call within 24 hours, Follow us on LinkedIn).
- Provide quick links to testimonials and recent case results to maintain engagement.

# Services & Results Experience Blueprint

## Services Matrix

- Layout: four service cards arranged 2x2 on desktop (columns 1-5, 6-10, etc.); stack vertically on mobile with 24px gaps.
- Card contents: service icon, service title, 2-line summary, bullet list of representative case types, and `Learn More` chevron link.
- Hover interaction: slight elevation, icon shifts to accent color, underline animates under link.
- CTA alignment: persistent `Request Consultation` button below grid for quick conversion.

## Process Infographic

- Five-step horizontal band showing timeline from "Initial Call" to "Resolution".
- Structure: numbered circles connected by gradient line; each step includes heading, short sentence, and supporting icon.
- Micro-interactions: on hover or focus, step expands and displays detail tooltip; on mobile, convert to vertical accordion with collapse/expand.

## Outcome Statistics Section

- Hero metrics row with three counters: Total Settlements, Average Client Rating, Response Time.
- Use animated count-up triggered on scroll (respect reduced motion by providing static numbers).
- Background: dark navy gradient with translucent overlay cards to highlight numbers; include supporting copy below counters.
- Include "View All Case Results" button linking to dedicated detail page and `Download Case Summary` secondary link.
